An Example Node Website
====

An example Node website and API. This is an example using Express framework for the website and a Restify based API - two web apps working together. Backbone is used on the front end to assist in this interaction.

##What is Node##

> Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.
